Because this project is maintained both in the OpenBSD tree using CVS and in
Git, it can be confusing following all of the changes.

Most of the libssl and libcrypto source code is is here in OpenBSD CVS:

	http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libssl/

Some of the libcrypto and OS-compatibility files for entropy and random number
generation are here:

	http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libcrypto/

A simplified TLS wrapper library is here:

	http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libtls/

The LibreSSL Portable project copies these portions of the OpenBSD tree, along
with relevant portions of the C library, to a Git repository. This makes it
easier to follow all of the relevant changes to the upstream project in a
single place:

	https://github.com/libressl-portable/openbsd

The portable bits of the project are largely maintained out-of-tree, and their
history is also available from Git.

LibreSSL Portable Release Notes:

This release primarily addresses a number of security issues in coordination
with the OpenSSL project.

2.2.1 - Build fixes, feature added, features removed

	* Assorted build fixes for musl, HP-UX, Mingw, Solaris.

	* Initial support for Windows 2009, 2003, XP

	* Protocol parsing conversions to BoringSSL's CRYPTO ByteString (CBS) API

	* Added EC_curve_nid2nist and EC_curve_nist2nid from OpenSSL

	* Removed Dynamic Engine support

	* Removed unused and obsolete MDC-2DES cipher

	* Removed workarounds for obsolete SSL implementations

2.2.0 - Build cleanups and new OS support, Security Updates

	* AIX Support - thanks to Michael Felt

	* Cygwin Support - thanks to Corinna Vinschen

	* Refactored build macros, support packaging libtls independently.
	  There are more pieces required to support building and using OpenSSL
	  with libtls, but this is an initial start at providing an
	  independent package for people to start hacking on.

	* Removal of OPENSSL_issetugid and all library getenv calls.
	  Applications can and should no longer rely on environment variables
	  for changing library behavior. OPENSSL_CONF/SSLEAY_CONF is still
	  supported with the openssl(1) command.

	* libtls API and documentation additions

	* Various bug fixes and simplifications to libssl and libcrypto

	* Fixes for the following issues are integrated into LibreSSL 2.2.0:
	 - CVE-2015-1788 - Malformed ECParameters causes infinite loop
	 - CVE-2015-1789 - Exploitable out-of-bounds read in X509_cmp_time
	 - CVE-2015-1792 - CMS verify infinite loop with unknown hash function

	* The following CVEs did not apply to LibreSSL or were fixed in
	  earlier releases:
	 - CVE-2015-4000 - DHE man-in-the-middle protection (Logjam)
	 - CVE-2015-1790 - PKCS7 crash with missing EnvelopedContent
	 - CVE-2014-8176 - Invalid free in DTLS

	* Fixes for the following CVEs are still in review for LibreSSL
	 - CVE-2015-1791 - Race condition handling NewSessionTicket

2.1.6 - Security update

	* Fixes for the following issues are integrated into LibreSSL 2.1.6:
	  - CVE-2015-0209 - Use After Free following d2i_ECPrivatekey error
	  - CVE-2015-0286 - Segmentation fault in ASN1_TYPE_cmp
	  - CVE-2015-0287 - ASN.1 structure reuse memory corruption
	  - CVE-2015-0288 - X509_to_X509_REQ NULL pointer deref
	  - CVE-2015-0289 - PKCS7 NULL pointer dereferences

	* The fix for CVE-2015-0207 - Segmentation fault in DTLSv1_listen
	  is integrated for safety, but LibreSSL is not vulnerable.

	* Libtls is now built by default. The --enable-libtls
	  configuration option is no longer required.
	  The libtls API is now stable for the 2.1.x series.

2.1.5 - Bug fixes and a security update
	* Fix incorrect comparison function in openssl(1) certhash command.
	  Thanks to Christian Neukirchen / Void Linux.

	* Windows port improvements and bug fixes.
	  - Removed a dependency on libgcc in 32-bit dynamic libraries.
	  - Correct a hang in openssl(1) reading from stdin on an connection.
	  - Initialize winsock in openssl(1) earlier, allow 'openssl ocsp' and
	    any other network-related commands to function properly.

	* Reject all server DH keys smaller than 1024 bits.

2.1.4 - Security and feature updates
	* Improvements to libtls:
	  - a new API for loading CA chains directly from memory instead of a
	    file, allowing verification with privilege separation in a chroot
	    without direct access to CA certificate files.

	  - Ciphers default to TLSv1.2 with AEAD and PFS.

	  - Improved error handling and message generation

	  - New APIs and improved documentation

	* Added X509_STORE_load_mem API for loading certificates from memory.
	  This facilitates accessing certificates from a chrooted environment.

	* New AEAD "MAC alias" allows configuring TLSv1.2 AEAD ciphers by
	  using 'TLSv1.2+AEAD' as the cipher selection string.

	* Dead and disabled code removal including MD5, Netscape workarounds,
	  non-POSIX IO, SCTP, RFC 3779 support, many #if 0 sections, and more.

	* ASN1 macro maze expanded to aid reading and searching the code.

	* NULL pointer asserts removed in favor of letting the OS/signal
	  handler catch them.

	* Refactored argument handling in openssl(1) for consistency and
	  maintainability.

	* New openssl(1) command 'certhash' replaces the c_rehash script.

	* Support for building with OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED

	* Server-side support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV for compatibility with
	  various auditor and vulnerability scanners.

	* Dozens of issues found with the Coverity scanner fixed.

	* Security Updates:

	  - Fix a minor information leak that was introduced in t1_lib.c
	    r1.71, whereby an additional 28 bytes of .rodata (or .data) is
	    provided to the network. In most cases this is a non-issue since
	    the memory content is already public. Issue found and reported by
	    Felix Groebert of the Google Security Team.

	  - Fixes for the following low-severity issues were integrated into
	    LibreSSL from OpenSSL 1.0.1k:

	     CVE-2015-0205 - DH client certificates accepted without
	                     verification
	     CVE-2014-3570 - Bignum squaring may produce incorrect results
	     CVE-2014-8275 - Certificate fingerprints can be modified
	     CVE-2014-3572 - ECDHE silently downgrades to ECDH [Client]
	     Reported by Karthikeyan Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA.

	    The following CVEs were fixed in earlier LibreSSL releases:
	     CVE-2015-0206 - Memory leak handling repeated DLTS records
	     CVE-2014-3510 - Flaw handling DTLS anonymous EC(DH) ciphersuites.

	    The following CVEs did not apply to LibreSSL:
	     CVE-2014-3571 - DTLS segmentation fault in dtls1_get_record
	     CVE-2014-3569 - no-ssl3 configuration sets method to NULL
	     CVE-2015-0204 - RSA silently downgrades to EXPORT_RSA

2.1.3 - Security update and OS support improvements
	* Fixed various memory leaks in DTLS, including fixes for
	  CVE-2015-0206.

	* Added Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) support.

	* Removed GOST R 34.10-94 signature authentication.

	* Removed nonfunctional Netscape browser-hang workaround code.

	* Simplfied and refactored SSL/DTLS handshake code.

	* Added SHA256 Camellia cipher suites for TLS 1.2 from RFC 5932.

	* Hide timing info about padding errors during handshakes.

	  session ID contexts. Work is ongoing with this library - feedback
	  and potential use-cases are welcome.

	* Support building Windows DLLs.
	  Thanks to Jan Engelhard.

	* Packaged config wrapper for better compatibility with OpenSSL-based
	  build systems.
	  Thanks to @technion from github

	* Ensure the stack is marked non-executable for assembly sections.
	  Thanks to Anthony G. Bastile.

	* Enable extra compiler hardening flags by default, where applicable.
	  The default set of hardening features can vary by OS to OS, so
	  feedback is welcome on this. To disable the default hardening flags,
	  specify '--disable-hardening' during configure.
	  Thanks to Jim Barlow

	* Initial HP-UX support, tested with HP-UX 11.31 ia64
	  Thanks to Kinichiro Inoguchi

	* Initial NetBSD support, tested with NetBSD 6.1.5 x86_64

	* Added reworked GOST cipher suite support
	   thanks to Dmitry Eremin-Solenikov

	* Enabled Camellia ciphers due to improved patent situation

	* Use builtin arc4random implementation on OS X and FreeBSD
