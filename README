This project repackages the OpenBSD (http://www.openbsd.org/) fork of
OpenSSL (https://www.openssl.org/), LibreSSL (http://www.libressl.org/), so
it is buildable on other systems.

To build, you need autoconf, automake and libtool installed.
To run all unit tests, you need python installed as well.

Run 'autogen.sh' followed by './configure; make; make check'

To build a tarball, run 'make dist'

You may need to periodically clean/dist-clean your source tree or rerun
autogen.sh/update.sh in order to import the latest source from the git
submodules.

Warning:
This is an alpha work-in-progress, not ready for general use. It is based on
semi-regular snapshots of the upstream code with minimal patching (see the
compat_fixes branches on the upstream import trees for current patches).

Use it this check application compatibility, security research, code auditing,
or to just see what the LibreSSL team is up to. Just don't use it in
production!

Please also read Nick Mathewson's warning on libottery. While we are not
currently incorporating this library for random numbers, the warning is still
relevant.

Caveat Emptor:
While this project uses compatibility shims and imports functions from
OpenBSD's libc, it is a continual challenge to make it work exactly the same as
if it is running on OpenBSD.  Until there is an official port of LibreSSL (and
even after), please conduct your own audits and patches are always welcome.

See crypto/compat for the bulk of the local compatibility code.

It has been tested to build on these platforms:
 Ubuntu 14.04 amd64 / armhf
 Centos 6.5 i686
 FreeBSD 10 amd64
 Mac OS X 10.9.3
