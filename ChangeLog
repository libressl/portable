Because this project is maintained both in the OpenBSD tree using CVS and in
Git, it can be confusing following all of the changes.

Most of the libssl and libcrypto source code is is here in OpenBSD CVS:

	http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libssl/

Some of the libcrypto and OS-compatibility files for entropy and random number
generation are here:

	http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libcrypto/

A simplified TLS wrapper library is here:

	http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libtls/

The LibreSSL Portable project copies these portions of the OpenBSD tree, along
with relevant portions of the C library, to a Git repository. This makes it
easier to follow all of the relevant changes to the upstream project in a
single place:

	https://github.com/libressl-portable/openbsd

The portable bits of the project are largely maintained out-of-tree, and their
history is also available from Git.

LibreSSL Portable Release Notes:

2.3.1 - ASN.1 and time handling cleanups

	* ASN.1 cleanups and RFC5280 compliance fixes.

	* Time representations switched from 'unsigned long' to 'time_t'. LibreSSL
	  now checks if the host OS supports 64-bit time_t.

	* Fixed a leak in SSL_new in the error path.

	* Support always extracting the peer cipher and version with libtls.

	* Added ability to check certificate validity times with libtls,
	  tls_peer_cert_notbefore and tls_peer_cert_notafter.

	* Changed tls_connect_servername to use the first address that resolves with
	  getaddrinfo().

	* Remove broken conditional EVP_CHECK_DES_KEY code (non-functional since
	  initial commit in 2004).

	* Fixed a memory leak and out-of-bounds access in OBJ_obj2txt, reported
	  by Qualys Security.

	* Fixed an up-to 7 byte overflow in RC4 when len is not a multiple of
	  sizeof(RC4_CHUNK), reported by Pascal Cuoq <cuoq at trust-in-soft.com>.

	* Reject too small bits value in BN_generate_prime_ex(), so that it does
	  not risk becoming negative in probable_prime_dh_safe(), reported by
		Franck Denis.

	* Enable nc(1) builds on more platforms.

2.3.0 - SSLv3 removed, libtls API changes, portability improvements

	* SSLv3 is now permanently removed from the tree.

	* The libtls API is changed from the 2.2.x series.

	  The read/write functions work correctly with external event
	  libraries.  See the tls_init man page for examples of using libtls
	  correctly in asynchronous mode.

	  Client-side verification is now supported, with the client supplying
	  the certificate to the server.

	  Also, when using tls_connect_fds, tls_connect_socket or
	  tls_accept_fds, libtls no longer implicitly closes the passed in
	  sockets. The caller is responsible for closing them in this case.

	* When loading a DSA key from an raw (without DH parameters) ASN.1
	  serialization, perform some consistency checks on its `p' and `q'
	  values, and return an error if the checks failed.

	  Thanks for Georgi Guninski (guninski at guninski dot com) for
	  mentioning the possibility of a weak (non prime) q value and
	  providing a test case.

	  See
	  https://cpunks.org/pipermail/cypherpunks/2015-September/009007.html
	  for a longer discussion.

	* Fixed a bug in ECDH_compute_key that can lead to silent truncation
	  of the result key without error. A coding error could cause software
	  to use much shorter keys than intended.

	* Removed support for DTLS_BAD_VER. Pre-DTLSv1 implementations are no
	  longer supported.

	* The engine command and parameters are removed from the openssl(1).
	  Previous releases removed dynamic and builtin engine support
	  already.

	* SHA-0 is removed, which was withdrawn shortly after publication 20
	  years ago.

	* Added Certplus CA root certificate to the default cert.pem file.

	* New interface OPENSSL_cpu_caps is provided that does not allow
	  software to inadvertently modify cpu capability flags.
	  OPENSSL_ia32cap and OPENSSL_ia32cap_loc are removed.

	* The out_len argument of AEAD changed from ssize_t to size_t.

	* Deduplicated DTLS code, sharing bugfixes and improvements with
	  TLS.

	* Converted 'nc' to use libtls for client and server operations; it is
	  included in the libressl-portable distribution as an example of how
	  to use the library.

2.2.3 - Bug fixes, build enhancements

	* LibreSSL 2.2.2 incorrectly handles ClientHello messages that do not
	  include TLS extensions, resulting in such handshakes being aborted.
	  This release corrects the handling of such messages. Thanks to
	  Ligushka from github for reporting the issue.

	* Added install target for cmake builds. Thanks to TheNietsnie from
	  github.

	* Updated pkgconfig files to correctly report the release version
	  number, not the individual library ABI version numbers. Thanks to
	  Jan Engelhardt for reporting the issue.

2.2.2 - More TLS parser rework, bug fixes, expanded portable build support

	* Switched 'openssl dhparam' default from 512 to 2048 bits

	* Reworked openssl(1) option handling

	* More CRYPTO ByteString (CBC) packet parsing conversions

	* Fixed 'openssl pkeyutl -verify' to exit with a 0 on success

	* Fixed dozens of Coverity issues including dead code, memory leaks,
	  logic errors and more.

	* Ensure that openssl(1) restores terminal echo state after reading a
	  password.

	* Incorporated fix for OpenSSL Issue #3683

	* LibreSSL version define LIBRESSL_VERSION_NUMBER will now be bumped
	  for each portable release.

	* Removed workarounds for TLS client padding bugs.

	* No longer disable ECDHE-ECDSA on OS X

	* Removed SSLv3 support from openssl(1)

	* Removed IE 6 SSLv3 workarounds.

	* Modified tls_write in libtls to allow partial writes, clarified with
	  examples in the documentation.

	* Removed RSAX engine

	* Tested SSLv3 removal with the OpenBSD ports tree and found several
	  applications that were not ready to build without SSLv3 yet. For
	  now, building a program that intentionally uses SSLv3 will result in
	  a linker warning.

	* Added TLS_method, TLS_client_method and TLS_server_method as a
	  replacement for the SSLv23_*method calls.

	* Added initial cmake build support, including support for building with
	  Visual Studio, currently tested with Visual Studio 2013 Community
	  Edition.

	* --with-enginesdir is removed as a configuration parameter

	* Default cert.pem, openssl.cnf, and x509v3.cnf files are now
	  installed under $sysconfdir/ssl or the directory specified by
	  --with-openssldir. Previous versions of LibreSSL left these empty.

2.2.1 - Build fixes, feature added, features removed

	* Assorted build fixes for musl, HP-UX, Mingw, Solaris.

	* Initial support for Windows Embedded 2009, Server 2003, XP

	* Protocol parsing conversions to BoringSSL's CRYPTO ByteString (CBS) API

	* Added EC_curve_nid2nist and EC_curve_nist2nid from OpenSSL

	* Removed Dynamic Engine support

	* Removed unused and obsolete MDC-2DES cipher

	* Removed workarounds for obsolete SSL implementations

2.2.0 - Build cleanups and new OS support, Security Updates

	* AIX Support - thanks to Michael Felt

	* Cygwin Support - thanks to Corinna Vinschen

	* Refactored build macros, support packaging libtls independently.
	  There are more pieces required to support building and using OpenSSL
	  with libtls, but this is an initial start at providing an
	  independent package for people to start hacking on.

	* Removal of OPENSSL_issetugid and all library getenv calls.
	  Applications can and should no longer rely on environment variables
	  for changing library behavior. OPENSSL_CONF/SSLEAY_CONF is still
	  supported with the openssl(1) command.

	* libtls API and documentation additions

	* Various bug fixes and simplifications to libssl and libcrypto

	* Fixes for the following issues are integrated into LibreSSL 2.2.0:
	 - CVE-2015-1788 - Malformed ECParameters causes infinite loop

	  - CVE-2015-0288 - X509_to_X509_REQ NULL pointer deref
	  - CVE-2015-0289 - PKCS7 NULL pointer dereferences

	* The fix for CVE-2015-0207 - Segmentation fault in DTLSv1_listen
	  is integrated for safety, but LibreSSL is not vulnerable.

	* Libtls is now built by default. The --enable-libtls
	  configuration option is no longer required.
	  The libtls API is now stable for the 2.1.x series.

2.1.5 - Bug fixes and a security update
	* Fix incorrect comparison function in openssl(1) certhash command.
	  Thanks to Christian Neukirchen / Void Linux.

	* Windows port improvements and bug fixes.
	  - Removed a dependency on libgcc in 32-bit dynamic libraries.

2.1.4 - Security and feature updates
	* Improvements to libtls:
	  - a new API for loading CA chains directly from memory instead of a
	    file, allowing verification with privilege separation in a chroot
	    without direct access to CA certificate files.

	  - Ciphers default to TLSv1.2 with AEAD and PFS.

	  - Improved error handling and message generation

	  - New APIs and improved documentation

	* Added X509_STORE_load_mem API for loading certificates from memory.
	  This facilitates accessing certificates from a chrooted environment.

	* New AEAD "MAC alias" allows configuring TLSv1.2 AEAD ciphers by
	  using 'TLSv1.2+AEAD' as the cipher selection string.

	* Dead and disabled code removal including MD5, Netscape workarounds,
	  non-POSIX IO, SCTP, RFC 3779 support, many #if 0 sections, and more.

	* ASN1 macro maze expanded to aid reading and searching the code.

	* NULL pointer asserts removed in favor of letting the OS/signal
	  handler catch them.

	* Refactored argument handling in openssl(1) for consistency and
	  maintainability.

	* New openssl(1) command 'certhash' replaces the c_rehash script.

	* Support for building with OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED

	* Server-side support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV for compatibility with
	  various auditor and vulnerability scanners.

	* Dozens of issues found with the Coverity scanner fixed.

	* Security Updates:

	  - Fix a minor information leak that was introduced in t1_lib.c
	    r1.71, whereby an additional 28 bytes of .rodata (or .data) is
	    provided to the network. In most cases this is a non-issue since
	    the memory content is already public. Issue found and reported by
	    Felix Groebert of the Google Security Team.

	  - Fixes for the following low-severity issues were integrated into
	    LibreSSL from OpenSSL 1.0.1k:
