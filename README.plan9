# Building LibreSSL #

**This is very early version.**

## Prerequisites when building from a Git checkout ##

1. Ensure you have the following packages installed: git
2. Run `./autogen.rc` to prepare the source tree for building.

## Steps that apply to all builds ##

Before building LibreSSL, You must install latest 9legacy stable patches, and
two pull-requests for 0intro/plan9-contrib.

* https://github.com/0intro/plan9-contrib/pull/6
* https://github.com/0intro/plan9-contrib/pull/7

Once you have a source tree, either by downloaded using git and having
run the `autogen.sh` script above, or by downloading a release distribution from
an OpenBSD mirror, run these commands to build and install the package on most
systems:

```sh
./gen-mkfile.sh lib crypto/Makefile.am
./gen-mkfile.sh lib ssl/Makefile.am
./gen-mkfile.sh lib tls/Makefile.am
./gen-mkfile.sh bin apps/openssl/Makefile.am
./gen-mkfile.sh include include/Makefile.am
mk
mk install
```

# Development

If you catch any problem, you can update patches in plan9 directory.
For example, to merge a changes for crypto/cpt_err.c into crypto.patch:

 git clean -xf
 IGNOREPLAN9PATCHES=1 ./autogen.rc
 mkdir (crypto ssl tls apps)^.orig
 for(i in crypto ssl tls apps)
       dircp $i $i.orig

Feel free edit crypto/cpt_err.c, then update a patch:

 ape/diff -uprN -X mkfile crypto.orig crypto >plan9/crypto.patch
