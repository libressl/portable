Because this project is maintained both in the OpenBSD tree using CVS and in
Git, it can be confusing following all of the changes.

Most of the libssl and libcrypto source code is is here in OpenBSD CVS:

	http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libssl/

Some of the libcrypto and OS-compatibility files for entropy and random number
generation are here:

	http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libcrypto/

A new simplified SSL wrapper library is here:

	http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libtls/

The LibreSSL Portable project copies these portions of the OpenBSD tree, along
with relevant portions of the C library, to a Git repository. This makes it
easier to follow all of the relevant changes to the upstream project in a
single place:

	https://github.com/libressl-portable/openbsd/commits/master

The portable bits of the project are largely maintained out-of-tree, and their
history is also available from Git.

LibreSSL Portable Release Notes:

2.1.2 - Many new features and improvements
	* Added reworked GOST cipher suite support
	   thanks to Dmitry Eremin-Solenikov

	* Enabled Camellia ciphers due to improved patent situation

	* Use builtin arc4random implementation on OS X and FreeBSD
	   this addresses some deficiencies in the native implementations of
	   these operating systems, see commit logs for more information

	* Added initial Windows mingw-w64 support (32 and 64-bit)
	   thanks to Song Dongsheng and others for code and feedback

	* Enabled assembly optimizations on x86_64 CPUs
	   supports Linux, *BSD, Solaris and OS X operating systems
	   thanks to Wouter Clarie for the initial implementation

	* Added no_ssl3/no_tls1_1/no_tls1_2 options to openssl(1)

	* Improved build infrastructure, 'make distcheck' now passes
	   this simplifies and speeds developer efficiency
	   thanks to Dmitry Eremin-Solenikov and Wouter Clarie

	* Allow conditional building of the libtls library
	   expect the API and ABI of the library to change
	   feedback is welcome

	* Fixes for more memory leaks, cleanups, etc.

2.1.1 - Security update
	* Address POODLE attack by disabling SSLv3 by default

	* Fix Eliptical Curve cipher selection bug
	  (https://github.com/libressl-portable/portable/issues/35)

2.1.0 - First release from the OpenBSD 5.7 tree
	* Added support for automatic ephemeral EC keys

	* Fixes for many memory leaks and overflows in error handlers

	* The TLS padding extension (that works around bugs in F5 terminators) is
	  off by default

	* support for getrandom(2) on Linux 3.17

	* the NO_ASM macro is no longer being set, providing the first bits toward
	  enabling other assembly offloads.

2.0.5 - Fixes for CVEs from OpenSSL 1.0.1i
	* CVE-2014-3506
	* CVE-2014-3507
	* CVE-2014-3508 (partially vulnerable)he
	* CVE-2014-3509
	* CVE-2014-3510
	* CVE-2014-3511
	* Synced LibreSSL Portable with the release version of OpenBSD 5.6

2.0.4 - Portability fixes, deleted unused SRP code

2.0.3 - Portability fixes, improvements to fork detection

2.0.2 - Address arc4random fork PID wraparound issues with pthread_atfork

2.0.1 - Portability fixes:
	* Removed -Werror and and other non-portable compiler flags

	* Allow setting OPENSSLDIR and ENGINSDIR

2.0.0 - First release from the OpenBSD 5.6 tree
	* Removal of many obsolete features and coding conventions from the OpenSSL
	  1.0.1h source
